Too many tools with specialized workflows? Take back your control.

Woost is a collaboration tool that aims to be simpler and more powerful thanks to a new structuring paradigm. (link: learn about the technical details)

It supports basic features like chats, tasks and kanban boards, but is not limited to static or predefined workflows.
Think: The flexibility of Excel meets collaboration and communication.

Vision
Our vision is to scale communication and collaboration to an arbitrary number of participants while maintaining perfect overview. Imagine 100.000 active users in the same chat. This is clearly conceptually unfeasible with the tools of today. Instead we form hierarchies of people and develop processes to communicate up and down. The inefficient communication through these hierarchies wastes a lot of time and money. A solution to this problem would be a breakthrough for large organizations, as well as a paradigm shift in E-Democracy, as it would allow for large-scale participation without limiting the options to voting.
Woost is an important step in this direction.


Technical details
For Woost to be as simple and powerful as possible, we map orthogonal (independent) concepts like information structuring, process stages, messaging, versioning and collaborative editing to a graph (network) structure. Vertices represent pieces of information, while edges (connections) represent the semantic interaction between different information pieces.
This allows to combine different concepts arbitrarily to create individual workflows that scale with the requirements of the team.

Like in the human brain, conversations and concepts are not stored chronologically, but with topic-based associations. There would be no more searching in a chat history, but more of an exploration of a highly structured dynamic information network.

To structure information in the graph, we fused the concepts of folder-hierarchies and tagging to eliminate both of their trade-offs. It can be understood as "One file can live in multiple folders".
